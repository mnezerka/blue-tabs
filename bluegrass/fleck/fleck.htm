<h2>Bela Fleck: Born to play banjo</h2>
 <p>
by Seth Rogovoy<p>

WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Aug. 1, 1996 -- Every instrument has had its 
visionaries who have pushed it beyond all known limits. For the 
saxophone it was Charlie Parker. The piano had Thelonious Monk.  
Jimi Hendrix virtually reinvented the electric guitar.  <p>

What these musicians were to their instruments, Bela Fleck has been 
to the banjo. He has taken it from its fixed role as a lead 
instrument in the traditional bluegrass ensemble, restored it to its 
long-forgotten home in the jazz band, and by recognizing no 
limitations on its potential, transformed the way it is played and 
imagined.  <p>

What first drove Fleck to approach the banjo in a non-conventional 
fashion, however, may have been nothing more than the desire to fit 
in with his peers.  <p>

"I went to the Fiorello LaGuardia High School of Music and Art, 
which was in Harlem," said the native New Yorker, speaking in a 
recent phone interview from his current home in Nashville.  <p>

"I liked all the different kinds of music people there were doing, 
and I wanted to be part of things, yet I was stuck on this weird 
instrument," said Fleck, who performs with his trio, the Flecktones, 
and special guest Paul McCandless, on Saturday night at 8, at the 
National Music Center in Lenox.  <p>

"When I had my banjo and I was in front of the school, if I started 
playing bluegrass, which I did, people's arms would start flapping 
and they'd all start making yee-haw jokes," said Fleck.  "But if I 
played Led Zeppelin stuff or Yes stuff people would get really 
impressed and then they'd think I was cool." <p>

Who would have thought that at the root of Fleck's ground-breaking, 
new-acoustic fusion -- in which progressive bluegrass meets 
contemporary jazz -- was a simple case of peer pressure getting the 
best of a budding artist. But the one thing peer pressure was never 
able to do was to dissuade the young Fleck, who got his first banjo 
at age 15 in 1973, from sticking with his chosen instrument.  <p>

"Some people say banjo is an instrument you either love or hate," 
said Fleck. "For me I just instantly loved it. I couldn't put it 
down for days. I didn't want to go to sleep. I got up early to play 
it. I thought about it in my spare time. On the bus to school I was 
thinking about it. I was so excited to get home and play it again. I 
tried to play other instruments, but nothing else ever really caught 
on, nothing else called out to me that way." <p>

It wasn't only a desire to win the approval of his peers that drove 
Fleck to experiment on his instrument. "I love very earthy music 
that has a lot of traditioanl elements, and I love complexity and 
being challenged and exploring," he said.  <p>

"The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix and Chick Corea and bands like Yes, 
and bluegrass bands later on, they were all like superheroes to me.  
So even when I got my first banjo I was trying to bend blues notes 
and figure out jazz licks and blues licks, bringing ideas over to it 
from what I was hearing. And growing up in New York City, I couldn't 
exactly cop a real traditional attitude. It just wouldn't have been 
right." <p>

Fleck points out the irony in that what people refer to as 
traditional bluegrass is in fact a relatively recent music.  
"Bluegrass really started in the '40s," he said. "So we're talking 
about a music that's really very young. So I don't think it's 
necessarily appropriate to be making finite rules about the way the 
music should go when it's so new. When you do that, you make the 
music into a classical form, where you have to obey certain rules or 
it's not <EM>that</EM> anymore." <p>

The 38-year-old Fleck has been breaking rules professionally for 
nearly 20 years. He came to prominence, and began earning a string 
of seemingly endless Grammy nominations, with the New Grass Revival, 
a progressive bluegrass outfit, with whom he played from 1981 to 
1988. Since 1989, he has performed with his own group, the 
Flecktones, which now includes bassist Victor Wooten and 
drummer/percussionist Future Man, each of whom are are at least as 
innovative on their instruments as Fleck.  <p>

Fleck has also enjoyed musical collaborations with the likes of 
Bruce Hornsby, Branford Marsalis, Chick Corea, Tony Rice, Phish, 
Garth Brooks, Amy Grant and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. McCandless, who 
is a member of the world jazz group Oregon, plays oboe, English 
horn, soprano sax, bass clarinet and pennywhistle, and has become a 
sort of unofficial fourth member of the Flecktones.  <p>

While Fleck is constantly thinking of new ways to expand his musical 
palette -- he'd like to perform with a symphony orchestra and has 
been collaborating with traditional musicians from around the world 
-- he still returns to traditional bluegrass whenever he can.  <p>

"It's like falling off a log for me, I feel so comfortable," he 
said. "Because playing jazz and new music and all the things we do 
in some way is a little bit of a strain. There's not a natural place 
in it for the banjo, so I'm always trying to find something, 
searching, trying, exploring different things.  <p>

"In bluegrass, I know <EM>exactly</EM> what you're supposed to do.  
So when I get to play bluegrass with great bluegrass musicians it's 
just such a joy. For me, what's best is some kind of balance between 
all the different kinds of music." <p>
